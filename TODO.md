ENSURE WEBSITE DOES THESE:
Quality: Your individual contribution to the group project should meet a professional standard, whether in coding, design, narrative development, research, organisation, communication, documentation, or analysis. Attention to detail is crucial, as is appropriate referencing of critical, creative, technical, and theoretical sources.

Creativity: Your project should demonstrate originality and a willingness to extend beyond lecture content. This could involve experimenting with innovative forms of data visualisation, making intentional choices regarding data usage, aesthetics, imagery, text, layout, and technologies, or employing creative approaches to group organisation that align with your project's themes.

Critical awareness: Your work should reflect engagement with theoretical, historical, and technical discussions from lectures, as well as independent research. This may be demonstrated through your approach to working with data, structuring or designing the website and narrative, or fostering inclusivity in the way your group collaborated and communicated.

Conceptual and narrative progression: The project should effectively communicate its story, artistic or design concept, and organisational approach. The website should present a clear and compelling exploration of your dataset, guiding users through the narrative in a meaningful and engaging way.
